# Student Exam Performance Indicator
Developed an end-to-end machine learning project to predict students' math scores based on diverse features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle's "Students Performance in Exams" and underwent thorough preprocessing before training and testing various machine learning models.
