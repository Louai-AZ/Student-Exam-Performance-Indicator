# Student Exam Performance Indicator
This is an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts a student's math score based on various features, including gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. This project was created by following the playlist of Mr. Krish Naik on YouTube to learn how an end-to-end machine learning project should be done.

# # Credits
I would like to give credit to Mr. Krish Naik, whose YouTube playlist inspired me to create this project. His tutorials were instrumental in helping me understand the concepts of machine learning and building a complete project from scratch. I highly recommend his channel for anyone interested in learning more about data science and machine learning.

# # Project Overview
The project is built using Python and various machine learning libraries, including Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The data used for the project was obtained from the Kaggle dataset, "Students Performance in Exams," which contains information about students' performance in various exams. The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned before being used to train and test various machine learning models.
